# beautifuldiscord-nametags
Adds nametag functionality to BeautifulDiscord, MyDiscord, or even any old custom CSS injector!

## OwO What's this?
This snippet adds custom nametags to Discord! 'What's that?' you may be asking. Well, it looks something like this:

## How do?
Well, there's two ways.
### The first way, manual creation
To do this, download the repo and edit `examplenametag.css`, then drop that into your Custom CSS file/box.
### The second way, generate dat shit (The easier way)
Now, if you're like me, you don't know much about CSS, and that's fine, I get you. That's why me and some friends created [a nifty generator.](https://gallium.typeform.com/to/smWy5Z)

## F.A.Q
> Can I have more than one of these?

Yes! Just create (or generate) another and drop it in too!
> OI YOU FUCKED UP THIS DON'T WORK

Holy shit, calm down, bro. Just report an issue or, if you know how to fix it, submit a PR.
